# Readme

This repository contains some few examples which I used when learning some visualization basics with interaction in QT.

The most useful one could be an exemplary Python-QT implementation of a linear transfer function that I also use in another project.
See [file](src/qtpex/qt_widgets/transferfunction_widget.py), with [example](./src/qtpex/qt_examples/qt_transferfunction_example/main.py).

The second could be a trivial ''proof-of-concept'' example of using an OpenGL Widget together with Python-QT; see [file](https://github.com/rbnbr/QTPythonExamples/blob/main/src/qtpex/qt_examples/qt_opengl_example/main.py).
